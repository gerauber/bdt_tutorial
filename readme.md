# Installation and general comments

## Environment

Download the appropriate Python Anaconda version from `https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/`, 
depending what machine you are using, and run the installer. 
Then, you will be able to create a virtual environment with all the packages needed for the analysis by running:

```conda env create -f hep_ml.yaml```

This will take a while. Once the environment is created, you can activate it by typing

```conda activate hep_ml```
